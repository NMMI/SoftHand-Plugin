# Gazebo Simulation of the QBRobotics v1.2 and IIT SoftHandWide

## 1) Description 

![SoftHand](https://github.com/IIT-SoftBots/SoftHand-Plugin/blob/master/images/soft-hand-gazebo.jpg)

This repository contains the ROS/Gazebo packages for the simulation of the Pisa/IIT hand:
* [NMMI web page](https://www.naturalmachinemotioninitiative.com/softhand)
* [Centro Piaggio web page](https://www.centropiaggio.unipi.it/pisaiit-softhand)

### Pacakges
* **softhands_description** - contains the urdf descriptions of the different versions of the hand
* **softhand_plugin** - contains the two Gazebo model plugins for simulating the hand

## 2) Getting Started

The above packages are tested on ROS Noetic and no external dependencies are required. To install the packages in this repository, clone it into your catkin workspace source folder (e.g., `catkin_ws/src`), checkout to the desired branch, and `catkin_make`.

```
cd catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/NMMI/SoftHand-Plugin.git
cd ..
catkin_make
```

## 3) Usage

Two different versions (1.2 and Wide) of the SoftHand are present. Launch examples are present:


* To spawn a hand inside Gazebo
```
roslaunch softhands_description softhands_gazebo.launch sh_version:=v1_2_research
```

Available versions:
```
sh_version:=v1_2_research
sh_version:=v1_wide
```
